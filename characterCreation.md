# Character Creation
# Your Character Concept _Is Your Character Sheet_

In this game, character creation is a narrative-driven process where your concept directly defines your character’s capabilities. There are no rigid attribute scores or min-maxing tables—your character is built through _Descriptors_, concise passages that encapsulate key aspects of their identity. These Descriptors provide both narrative and mechanical effects, making character creation intuitive yet flexible.
## The Foundation: Descriptors

Descriptors are short, evocative statements that define your character’s strengths, skills, quirks, and supernatural abilities. Each Descriptor consists of two parts:
* **Narrative Passage:** A brief 1-to-5 sentence description that provides context and flavor.
* **Effects:** The mechanical benefits attached to the Descriptor.
Each new character begins with up to **five Descriptors**, which form the core of their abilities. These Descriptors should reflect the character’s background, skills, and traits that define them in the story.

#### Example Descriptors

> **Resilient**
> 
> Alex has trained his body his whole life, resulting in a physique that can withstand various exertions. Long marathons, climbing, hiking, and other stamina-exhausting activities are no problem for him. He can endure more punishment in combat.
> *Effects: +5 HP, +5 Stamina*

> **Livewire**
> 
> The mutation has turned Debra into a living electricity generator. With a snap of her hand, she can conjure a lightning bolt or any electrical current.
> *Effects: Ranged Attack, Melee Attack, +3 Bonus, Powers*

### Scale and Details of Descriptors

A descriptor can be adjusted according to the theme and note of the game. The GM needs to inform the player of the theme of the game so that the players can adjust accordingly. For example, if the game is about a bunch of new recruits to a special force, then it's the descriptors need to eb detailed on what the recruits can do. The descriptors need to accurately enumerate what kinds of weapons they can effectively use, what combat skills they have, how tough they are, etc. But if the game is telling a story about a party of highly skilled veteran superspy, then the descriptors needs to be scaled down. Instead of enumerating each and every weapon skills, players can just put down "Arms Mastery". Instead of mentioning every types of martial arts the spy can do, the players can just put down "Unarmed Mastery".
## The Mechanics: Effects

Effects translate Descriptors into mechanical advantages, allowing them to interact with the game’s resolution system. Each new character begins with **15 Effect Points** to distribute among their starting Descriptors.
### List of Effects:

* **Bonus:** Grants a flat numerical bonus to a roll when the Descriptor applies. Each instance of this effect provides +1.
* **Melee Attack:** Enables the Descriptor to be used for melee attacks.
* **Ranged Attack:** Enables the Descriptor to be used for ranged attacks.
* **Powers:** Used for extraordinary abilities. When the situation logically allows, actions using this Descriptor may automatically succeed (e.g., using _Flying Wings_ to cross a chasm). Otherwise, this effect provides a +3 bonus when relevant. Using a Descriptor with Powers consumes Stamina equal to the number of Effects attached to it.

* **HP Bonus:** Increases the character’s health by +5 per stack.
* **Stamina Bonus:** Increases the character’s stamina by +5 per stack.
* **Recovery:** Allows the character to restore either HP or Stamina when the Descriptor is used. This effect can be applied multiple times, each adding +2 to the recovery amount. (HP and Stamina recovery cannot be mixed within a single Descriptor.)
* **Sabotage:** When this Descriptor is used, the character can impose a penalty on an opponent. If successful, the opponent’s Target Number (TN) for imposing obstacles on allies is reduced by 3.
* **Support:** When this Descriptor comes into play, the character grants a +3 bonus to an ally’s next roll, when relevant
## Step-by-Step Character Creation

Creating a character is a streamlined, creative process that prioritizes storytelling. Follow these steps to bring your character to life:
1. **Write a Character Concept. **Draft 3 to 5 paragraphs of freeform text describing your character. This should include their skills, favored attacks, personal quirks, and innate attributes.
1. **Choose Your Descriptors. **Identify up to 5 distinct Descriptors from your concept that define key aspects of your character.
1. **Assign Effects. **Distribute 15 Effect Points among your chosen Descriptors. You may stack Effects where allowed. Note that you cannot have any Descriptors that doesn't have any effects.
1. **Calculate HP and Stamina. **Start with a base of **10 HP and 10 Stamina**. Add any bonuses from your chosen Descriptors.
1. **Mark Attack Descriptors. **If a Descriptor includes an Attack effect (Melee or Ranged), highlight it for quick reference in combat.

### Buildalong: Creating a Character

Let's walk through the process by creating a sample character step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Character Concept

Meet Valeria, a former thief turned treasure hunter. She grew up in the bustling backstreets of a grand city, where quick thinking and nimble fingers meant the difference between survival and capture. Over the years, she honed her craft, slipping through the ***shadows unseen***, a skill that earned her the reputation of being nearly impossible to track. Her expertise in heists granted her the ability to act with surgical precision, using her ***quick hands*** to bypass locks and lift valuables without a sound.

As she ventured into treasure hunting, Valeria realized that her old skills were just as valuable in the ruins and tombs of forgotten civilizations. Her ***mastery of the dagger*** proved crucial when facing dangers lurking in the dark, allowing her to strike swiftly and efficiently. With every expedition, her instincts grew sharper, enabling her to evade falling traps and the grasp of merciless adversaries with an almost supernatural reflex.

But it wasn’t all about stealth and combat; Valeria had a ***silver tongue*** that often saved her where her blades could not. She knew how to talk her way out of bad situations, whether it was deceiving a guard, bluffing her way through an interrogation, or charming a fellow rogue into sharing valuable information. Her knack for persuasion made her an indispensable ally and a dangerous foe.

Despite her confidence, Valeria was not invincible. She had learned to pick her battles wisely, knowing when to engage and when to ***vanish into the shadows***. Her resilience and adaptability ensured that no obstacle—whether a locked chest, an armed mercenary, or a deadly trap—was beyond her ability to overcome. With each challenge she faced, she refined her skills, growing into a legend whispered among those who lived on the fringes of law and fortune.

#### Step 2: Choose Descriptors

From her concept, we define the following Descriptors:

> **Shadowstep**
> 
> Valeria has mastered the art of moving unseen, slipping between shadows like a ghost. Few can track her movements when she doesn't want to be found.
> *Effects: +3 Bonus, Sabotage*

> **Quick Hands**
> 
> Whether picking a lock or snatching an item unnoticed, Valeria's dexterity is second to none.
> *Effects: +2 Bonus*

> **Dagger Mastery**
> 
> Years of practice have made Valeria a deadly fighter with daggers, striking with speed and precision.
> *Effects: Melee Attack, +2 Bonus, Sabotage_*

> **Evasion Expert**
> 
> Valeria has an instinctive ability to dodge danger, reacting in the blink of an eye.
> *Effects: +5 Stamina, +2 Bonus, Sabotage*

> **Silver Tongue**
> 
> Her charm and quick thinking let her talk her way out of trouble more often than not.
> *Effects: +3 Bonus, Support*

#### Step 3: Assign Effects

Valeria has **15 Effect Points** to distribute. She assigns them as follows:

* **Shadowstep** (+3 Bonus) – 3 Points
* **Quick Hands** (+2 Bonus) – 2 Points
* **Dagger Mastery** (Melee Attack, +3 Bonus, Sabotage) – 4 Points
* **Evasion Expert** (+5 Stamina, +2 Bonus) – 3 Points
* **Silver Tongue** (+2 Bonus, Support) – 3 Points

#### Step 4: Calculate HP and Stamina

* **Base HP:** 10 (No HP bonuses assigned)
* **Base Stamina:** 10 + 5 (from Evasion Expert) = **15 Stamina**

#### Step 5: Mark Attack Descriptors

* **Dagger Mastery** is an attack descriptor.
