### Resolving Uncertain, Challenging, or Effortful Actions

In this system, the moments of uncertainty, challenge, and effort in your game aren't just barriers to overcome—they're opportunities to push the story forward, regardless of success or failure. Here, every dice roll becomes part of the narrative, shaping the path the characters walk.

#### 1. A Roll Where It Matters

Actions only call for dice rolls when the stakes are real: when the outcome is uncertain, the task demands notable skill or effort, and failure would have consequences that ripple through the story. Imagine a group of adventurers standing before a towering cliff, racing against time to reach the summit before nightfall. They won’t need a roll for tying their boots, but the scramble up the loose rocks? That’s where the dice come into play.
If the action is mundane—like opening an unlocked door—or lacks meaningful risk, no roll is needed. The story moves forward without pause.

#### 2. How to Resolve an Action

When a character attempts a significant action, follow these steps to resolve it:
1. **Describe the Attempt**
The player describes their character’s action, weaving it into the narrative and calling upon any relevant Descriptors. For instance: "I use my _Sleuth_ descriptor to search for hidden compartments in the desk."
1. **Build the Dice Pool**
The GM listens and approves any applicable Descriptors, with each adding 1d6 to the pool after the first and base 1d6. Maybe the player has "Quick Hands" in addition to "Sleuth"; both could apply, granting 3d6 to roll. The maximum descriptors that can be added to an action are 3 descriptors.
1. **Bonuses That Count**
Add bonuses to the total from Descriptor effects or situational factors. Perhaps a high-quality magnifying glass provides a +2 bonus to their roll.
1. **The Target Number (TN)**
The GM sets the difficulty based on the task at hand:
	* Challenging : **12**
	* Heroic : **18**
	* Improbable : **24**
1. **Roll and Add It Up**
The player rolls the dice pool and sums the results. Add any bonuses. A roll of 4, 5, and 3 with a +3 bonus yields a total of **15**.
1. **Compare to the TN**
The roll’s total determines success or failure. If the result meets or exceeds the TN, the action succeeds. Otherwise, the action fails, but the story takes an unexpected turn.

#### 3. What Happens Next

The roll’s outcome determines how the story moves forward:
* **Success:**
The character’s effort pays off. Rolling 15 against a TN of 15 means the hidden compartment springs open, revealing its secrets. The story proceeds smoothly.
* **Failure:**
Failure isn’t a dead end. Instead, it opens a new door. Imagine the same investigator rolling 12 against a TN of 15. The desk remains stubbornly shut, but the sound of their prying attracts a guard, introducing a new twist to the narrative. Repeated retries are unnecessary; failure adds texture and momentum to the unfolding story.
* **Partial Success (Optional):**
If a roll is close to the TN (e.g., within 2-3 points), the GM might allow partial success. In this case, the investigator finds a loose panel but disturbs the papers inside, damaging some of the clues.
* **Critical Success****:**
Going at least 10 above the TN means that the action is a critical success. The GM resolves the action as a success with either a Momentum award, or adding a related positive impact on top of the action. For example, a critical success in lockpicking a challenging lock could mean that the lockpicker now learns the pattern of all the locks in the building, therefore adding situational bonus of +2 when picking other locks in the same building.

#### 4. A Story-Driven Collaboration

The dice rolls are as much about storytelling as mechanics. Players and the GM collaborate to bring the results to life:
* **Player Creativity:**
Players describe their actions vividly and think about how their Descriptors apply. For instance: "I’m using my _Resilient_ descriptor to keep climbing, ignoring the biting cold."
* **GM Guidance:**
The GM adjudicates fairly, approving Descriptors that fit the narrative. They might say: "Your _Resilient_ descriptor applies to endurance but not speed; roll with 1d6."

#### 5. Setting the Stage for Rolls
The GM’s role in setting Target Numbers reflects the story’s stakes:
* **Challenging (12):** A task requiring existing skill to be tested, like spotting a hidden tripwire in dim light.
* **Heroic (18):** These actions pushes the heroes' skills to its limit, such as disabling a complex magical ward
* **Improbable (24):** Near-impossible challenges, such as performing surgery during an earthquake
The difficulty scale starts at "Challenging" by design. If an action doesn't merit that word and number, then it's not worth a roll. The action can be assumed a success. Similarly if an action is indeed impossible to be done by the characters, for example a mere man lifting 10 tonnes boulder, then no roll should even be attempted and the action rendered impossible.
