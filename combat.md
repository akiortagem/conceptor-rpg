# Core Combat Principles

### Fast-Paced, Cinematic Action

Combat in this system emphasizes storytelling and fluidity over rigid measurements. Instead of relying on grids or fixed positioning, encounters unfold in a way that prioritizes dramatic moments and player creativity. Movement and positioning are considered narratively, with a focus on significant battlefield elements rather than exact distances.

### Player-Driven Rolls

Players take center stage in combat, rolling for both their attacks and defenses. The Game Master (GM) facilitates the challenges, using environmental elements and situational factors to adjust difficulty. By keeping the dice in the players' hands, combat remains dynamic and engaging, encouraging active problem-solving rather than passive reaction.

### Descriptor-Driven Tactics

Descriptors define what characters can do in combat, as well as their vulnerabilities and strengths. Each action in combat is shaped by a characterâ€™s Descriptors, allowing for creative applications. A player using the "Livewire" Descriptor, for example, might not only deal electrical damage but also disable electronic opponents. Players who find innovative ways to use their Descriptors will often find greater success in battle.

# Key Combat Rules

### Attacks Automatically Hit

When a player declares an attack, the action succeeds in making contact with the target. There is no need to roll for accuracy. Instead, the effectiveness of an attack depends on how the player describes it and whether the target has any applicable Descriptors that provide immunity or resistance. Damage is applied directly to the targetâ€™s HP, and the GM narrates the consequences based on the attackâ€™s effects and the current battlefield conditions.

### Defending Against Attacks

Defense in this system is not about avoiding attacks entirely but mitigating damage through skill, positioning, or intervention. When an NPC targets a player, the GM sets a Target Number (TN) based on the attackerâ€™s Descriptors and any relevant environmental factors. Players roll to defend, using their own Descriptors creatively to explain how they evade or lessen the impact. Each character can make one defense roll per round unless an ally intervenes to protect them.
When the defense fails, the targeted PC's player chooses between :

* Have the damage dealt to their HP.
* Burn a descriptor

### Burning a Descriptor and Recovering it

As one of the two option when you failed to defend an attack, you may choose to burn one of your descriptor. This means that you cannot put said descriptor into play until it is recovered. This simulates an attack that's so debilitating that it renders one of your abilities null, for example, a shot to the leg would compromise your ability to run fast, and therefore burn your "Speedster" descriptor.
You can recover your burned descriptor by taking a rest. Each rest period recovers one of your burned descriptor.

### Combat Engagement and Targeting

Enemies are limited in how often they can target a single player to ensure combat remains engaging for all participants. A single NPC may only target a given player once per round, preventing any single character from being overwhelmed. If the enemy party outnumbers the players, the attacks are distributed fairly, ensuring that no single player is excessively pressured while others remain uninvolved.

### Reaching 0 HP

A player character reduced to 0 HP is out of combat but not necessarily dead. They may be revived by another player using an appropriate Descriptor, such as "Medic" or "Healing Magic," restoring HP based on the result of their revival attempt.  For NPCs, reaching 0 HP typically means death unless the attacking player explicitly states a non-lethal intent.

### Death and Scars

When a player character reaches 0 HP and becomes a target of attack, they cannot defend. Other PCs are still able to defend the PC. However, undefended, the player character has 2 choices :

* Death
* Permanently remove a descriptor

If a player chooses **Death**, the GM must treat this moment with high respect. The death of a PC must be impactful to the story and drives it forward. As a rule of thumb, the death of a PC must open an opportunity for the party. This can be an opportunity to escape a challenging combat. Or perhaps the death opens up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expose the weakness of the opponent. Whatever it is, the death of a PC cannot be a mundane event.

> ðŸ“Œ
> The battle was nearing its climax. The team had done everything they could, but the relentless assault from the warlord's elite guards left them battered. With her last ounce of strength, Akane (Karate Champ) positioned herself between the enemy and her injured allies. The warlord's blade came down, and without the ability to defend, she knew what this meant. As the strike landed, Akane's world faded to black. In her final moments, she let out a knowing smirkâ€”her sacrifice had given Bruce and Debra the opportunity they needed to escape. Her death was not in vain, as the warlord, impressed by her tenacity, declared a temporary truce, allowing the surviving party members to regroup and fight another day.

If a player chooses to **permanently remove a descriptor**, then they lose one of their descriptor **of the GM's choosing**. This descriptor cannot be recovered and similar descriptor cannot be obtained anymore. After the loss, the PC goes into a death-like state that renders them unable to act for the rest of the combat, and cannot be targeted by any hostile NPCs. After a rest, they may recover their HP as normal.

### Battlefield Dynamics

Rather than using strict measurements, battles take place in narratively defined environments. The GM establishes three key battlefield features at the start of combatâ€”such as a crumbling balcony, a loose chandelier, or an active conveyor beltâ€”that can be interacted with by both players and enemies. These features create tactical depth, allowing for creative uses of the environment. Players may introduce additional details to the battlefield as combat progresses, incorporating new elements to shift the tide of battle.

Instead of exact ranges, each creature positioning in the battlefield is measured only by near or far from each other. A creature can only attack with melee attack if their target is near. Far targets can only be attacked with ranged attacks. Moving near or far from a creature spends the action of a turn.

### Turn Structure and Player Choice
Combat does not rely on initiative rolls. Instead, players and enemies take turns in an alternating sequence, with the players deciding among themselves who acts first on their side. This collaborative turn order allows players to strategize together and sequence their actions for maximum effectiveness. Each player may perform one significant action per turn, such as attacking, reviving an ally, or manipulating the battlefield. Negligible actions, such as speaking or drawing a weapon, do not consume a turn.

In their turn, a PC can do either one of : **Attack**, **Brace**, **Move**, **Improvise** and **Interact**

***Attack.*** The player states a target for the PC to attack. Then include up to 3 descriptors that applies for the narrated attack. Apply bonuses from various sources, including the descriptors themselves or situational bonuses. Make the roll and subtract the target's HP by the roll result.

***Brace.*** This represents how a character might expect an incoming attack and assume a defensive position. Add the "Braced" descriptor for the PC until the next round. If there are defensive objects around, such as covers, or a trench, the GM can add the "Covered" descriptor on top of it.

> **Braced**
> 
> Expecting an incoming attack, you brace yourself and assume a defensive position to either parry or dodge it
> *effects: +3 Bonus*

> **Covered**
> 
> You are behind a cover, be it a trench, pile of sacks, a pillar, or even just a flipped table. This gives you advantage on avoiding ranged attacks from hostiles
> *effects: +3 Bonus*

***Move.*** The character moves one increment (near/far) towards a position, object, or a creature.

***Improvise.*** This option requires both the players and the GM to work together. The GM needs to design the battlefield so that the players can have freedom to improvise. Essentially, improvising means that the PC interacts with objects around them to add descriptors to their character. For example, moving upstairs in a fencing duel can give the character a "High Ground" descriptor. Pouring grease onto themselves gives them "Greased Up" descriptor. Picking up a loose rock can add "Rock Throw" descriptor. The Improvise action can also be used to use descriptors that either has the "Sabotage" or "Support" effects, but does not have any attack effects.

> **High Ground**
> 
> Being on the high ground is advantageous on some combat style. Fencing while higher for example, or sniping someone from a high tower.
> *effects: +2 Bonus*

> **Greased Up**
> 
> You are covered in grease, making it difficult for assailants to hold grab of you
> *effects: +2 Bonus*

**Interact.** Outside of the four mentioned, players can choose to interact with the battlefield around them. This means that the action that they do are narratively significant enough, but do not result in an addition of any descriptors. For example, pushing a button that would stop the self-destruct sequence of a spaceship, or reporting the situation of combat to an ally far away by recording it via a phone.

Otherwise, the action is not narratively significant. Of course PCs may talk to each other and strategize in-character in the middle of combat, or perhaps drawing a weapon needed for their descriptors. Mundane action such as these does not consume the action during their turn.

Outside their turn in the round, the PCs may ***React*** to a given situation or an NPC action. Their reaction can be ***Defend*** or ***Interrupt***.

***Defend.*** When a hostile NPC targets a PC, they automatically defend that attack. This can be done once per round. The player makes a roll against the NPC's attack TN. A PC can also defend another PC from an attack if they themselves hasn't defended yet. If the defense fails, depending on the descriptors, the attack may hit the defender instead of the target.

***Interrupt.*** If a PC has not defended on the round yet, they may choose to Interrupt an NPC action. This is usually to stop something bad from happening. Perhaps an NPC is about to push a remote bomb held in their hand and the PC interrupts by distracting the NPC. Make a roll as usual when applies, if succeed, the NPC changes its action. Or maybe a pillar in the battlefield is about to crumble, and the PC wishes to prop it up with a loose wooden beam. Interrupt action cannot be an attack or a defend.

### Tactical Depth and Strategy
Tactical play emerges from the interplay between Descriptors, player ingenuity, and the battlefield. Enemies exploit player weaknesses whenever possible, using their own Descriptors to target vulnerabilities. Players, in turn, can counteract threats by thinking creatively and leveraging their own abilities and the environment. Strategic synergy between playersâ€™ Descriptors can lead to powerful narrative momentsâ€”such as using "Livewire" to electrify a metal walkway, incapacitating multiple enemies at once.

# Sample Combat Turn

### Scenario Setup

A battle erupts within a dimly lit factory floor, its machinery still active. The GM establishes three key environmental elements: a pile of scrap metal, a precariously hanging crane hook, and a loose conveyor belt lever. The players face five security bots, reinforced with armor and equipped with flamethrowers.

### Round 1

#### **Turn 1: Player Action**
Debra, utilizing her "Livewire" Descriptor, overloads the craneâ€™s control system, causing the hook to swing violently and slam into one of the bots. The impact deals 5 damage, leaving the bot sparking and partially disabled.

#### **Turn 2: Enemy Action**
A damaged bot retaliates, targeting Bruce with a flamethrower. The GM sets the TN at 15. Bruce rolls a defense check, using his "Sleuth" Descriptor to spot a nearby metal sheet and use it as cover. His roll totals 15, successfully avoiding the flames.

#### **Turn 3: Player Action**
Akane charges at another bot, using her "Karate Champ" Descriptor to deliver a devastating roundhouse kick. The attack deals 6 damage, knocking the bot into an active conveyor belt.

#### **Turn 4: Enemy Action**
A bot targets Debra with another burst of flames. The TN is 14 due to the confined area. Debra rolls a defense check but falls short, taking 2 HP damage.

#### **Turn 5: Player Action**
Bruce notices the loose conveyor belt lever and pulls it, throwing one of the bots off balance, making it vulnerable to an incoming attack.

#### **Turn 6: Enemy Action**
Another bot attacks Akane with a mechanical swipe. The TN is 12 due to its damaged state. Akane rolls a defense check but falls short, taking 2 HP damage.

#### **Turn 7: Player Action**
Debra seizes the opportunity to electrify the conveyor belt, shocking the bot caught in its movement and disabling it entirely.

#### **Turn 8: Enemy Action**
The final bot targets Bruce with a flamethrower. The TN is 16 due to Bruceâ€™s exposed position. He rolls a defense check but falls short, taking 3 HP damage.

### End of Round 1

With some enemies disabled and the battlefield shifting, players must adapt their strategy to overcome the remaining threats, using both their Descriptors and the environment to their advantage.
