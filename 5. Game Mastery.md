# The Core Tenet: The Players Are the Heroes

As the Game Master (GM), your role is to guide the players through a compelling and immersive story. The player characters (PCs) are the driving force of the narrative—the heroes of the tale. The spotlight should always be on them, their choices, and their actions. Your role is not to challenge them for the sake of difficulty but to create a world that reacts dynamically to their decisions.

## Understanding NPCs

### NPCs as Narrative and Mechanical Constructs

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) exist to enrich the world, provide obstacles, and facilitate storytelling. Mechanically, they follow a structure similar to PCs but with a key distinction: **NPC Descriptors do not provide mechanical effects to the NPC**. Instead, each Descriptor an NPC has contributes to their **Target Number (TN)** when opposed by the PCs.
When a PC acts against an NPC, they roll against the **sum of the NPC’s relevant TNs on top of a base TN of 6**. This represents the cumulative challenge posed by the NPC’s traits, abilities, and presence.
An NPC also has HP. You can assign an arbitrary number of HP to the NPC, adjust according to the NPC's gravita, importance, and strength. Since NPC descriptors has no effect, when a descriptor consumes the NPCs stamina, you can instead reduce their stamina by the descriptor's TN. Accordingly, adjust the NPC's stamina like you adjust its HP. If you're having trouble deciding, you can use these rules of thumb as a base value :

* For HP, you can use multiplies of 12. With at least 36. This ensures that an NPC would at least be downed by 3 proper hits.
* For Stamina, you can sum all stamina-consuming descriptors, double it and add 10.

It should be noted that most NPC should have more HP than the PCs, even the weakest ones should at least has 12 HP as base, ensuring it goes down with 1 good roll.

When the NPC's attack hits, simply deduct the PC's HP by the difference of the PC's roll against the TN.

An NPC's stamina is consumed when a descriptor is some extraordinary ability that not every creature has. Simply deduct the stamina by the descriptor's TN. For that purpose these descriptors should be marked.

### Example NPC: Captain Elias Voss

A hardened veteran of countless battles, Captain Elias Voss commands with unwavering confidence. His presence on the battlefield is enough to inspire his allies and intimidate his foes. 

HP: 60

Stamina: 30

**Descriptors: **

* **Seasoned Commander (TN 7):** Years of experience have honed his tactical instincts, making him a formidable strategist.
* **Unshakable Resolve (TN 5):** He stands firm in the face of adversity, resisting intimidation and mental manipulation.
* **Master Duelist (TN 6):** His expertise with the saber allows him to outmaneuver less skilled combatants with ease.
* **Uncanny Strike (TN 10, Consumes Stamina):** The captain has developed an eye to track an opening on his foes, even the most miniscule ones. This sense has enabled him to strike fatal wounds when his opponents least expect it.

### NPCs vs. NPCs

NPCs do not roll against each other. When an NPC acts against another NPC, the GM determines the outcome based on the narrative and the NPCs’ relative strengths. However, this has an impact on the PCs—when a PC acts against an NPC that has recently triumphed in an NPC vs. NPC interaction, the PC gains a **situational penalty or bonus** depending on the circumstances.

**Example:** If an enemy warlord has just routed a band of rebels, their morale is high. A PC attempting to intimidate them into surrendering may suffer a penalty due to the warlord’s confidence.

## Designing the Battlefield

Combat in this system is not grid-based but focuses on dynamic and cinematic interactions. As the GM, you should introduce a battlefield that provides meaningful choices and opportunities for engagement.

### The Three Significant Features Rule

At the start of an encounter, define at least **three** significant battlefield features. These could be obstacles, environmental hazards, or elements that can be used creatively.

**Examples:**

* A crumbling bridge in a mountain pass fight.
* A chandelier that can be cut down in a ballroom duel.
* A row of unstable explosive barrels in a warehouse shootout.

Depending on what exists on the battlefield and the PCs actions, the GM should be flexible on giving situational bonuses and penalties to the party.

For example, fencing on a crumbling bridge is hard, so their rolls will be inflicted with -2 penalty. But a party with a demolitionist and a well placed bait might be able to exploit that fact by baiting a group of enemies to the bridge and blowing it to smitherens.

#### Optional: Momentum for Battlefield Changes

If using the **Momentum** mechanic, consider allowing players to spend Momentum to alter the battlefield. Examples include:
* Creating an environmental hazard (e.g., tipping over a vat of oil to create slippery terrain).
* Reinforcing a cover position to make it more durable.
* Weakening an enemy’s footing by damaging the ground beneath them.

## Running the Game

### Encouraging Player Creativity

Your role is to reward creative play and encourage players to think beyond the mechanics. If a player suggests an unconventional but reasonable approach to a problem, lean into it. Let the game mechanics support the story rather than dictate it.

### Pacing and Scene Management

A well-paced game balances **momentum** and **tension**. Use the following techniques:
* **Keep rolls meaningful:** Only call for dice rolls when failure has consequences.
* **Switch between action and downtime:** Give players time to breathe between tense encounters.
* **Use clocks and countdowns:** When tracking impending events, use segmented Clocks to create urgency and a sense of progression.

### Maintaining Player Engagement

* **Rotate spotlight time:** Ensure that every PC has moments to shine.
* **Tie failures into the narrative:** Turn setbacks into new challenges, not dead ends.
* **Facilitate collaboration:** Encourage players to build on each other’s ideas rather than compete for dominance.

## Player v Player

Every exciting stories out there must include internal conflict between the protagonists. It is understandable that yours could have it too. Be it something that you machined into roleplay, or perhaps the player characters just have a natural disagreement on how to save the world. The first thing that this game advises when such moment arises is to ***<u>resolve it narratively without any rolls.</u>***

The main pillar of this game is that the party is the hero. Losing a roll to another party member ***could*** mean that one of the party member is less of a hero than the other one, and this is not fun. ***However ***if the related players has consented to the PvP and know all the risks it brings to the party dynamic, then as a GM you should facilitate the fun.

When two character's action actively opposes one another, there are a couple options on how to resolve them.

1. A Contest of Rolls. Simply have both player roll as usual, include their descriptors as usual and roll. The highest rolls wins the actions
1. If any of the players are not confident with their luck in the game, they can opt to not roll and instead state a TN for the opposing player. The TN is calculated by a base of 6 + the number of included descriptors + any bonuses that applies for those descriptors
1. If no one wants a roll, they can resolve their actions by calculating their TNs with the larger one coming out on top

This also applies in combat where a PC attacks another. Simply apply the winning roll to deduct the target's HP. In case of TN vs TN, deduct the HP by the winning TN amount.
