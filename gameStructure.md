# A Framework for Play
This game is built to support a variety of playstyles, from structured narratives to freeform storytelling. It provides a foundation for resolving actions, handling conflicts, and progressing the story while leaving room for creativity and improvisation. The rules act as tools rather than strict guidelines, allowing players and GMs to shape the game in the way that best fits their group.
### The Rhythm of Play
Play is driven by player choices, narrative stakes, and mechanical interactions. The system supports both fast-paced and methodical approaches, but generally should look like so:
1. **Challenge Introduction** – The setting, stakes, and potential conflicts are established.
1. **Player Decisions** – Characters take actions informed by their Descriptors and abilities.
1. **Resolution Mechanics** – Rolls and modifiers come into play when uncertainty exists.
1. **Consequences & Progression** – The story evolves based on player actions and mechanical outcomes.
GMs are free to incorporate those points in their playstyle alongside the party. Some party might prefer scene-based gameplay, some other might prefer continuous slow-burn long narrative. The game does not assume and force anyone to follow whichever.
However there are several mechanics that needs to be integrated to the GM's flow structure.

## Clocks: Managing Progression
Clocks are a tool for tracking complex or time-sensitive actions. They are flexible and can represent anything from breaking into a vault to a city’s descent into chaos. Clocks typically have **4, 6, 8, or 10 segments**, each representing a step toward completion.
### Using Clocks
* **Incrementing Clocks** – Players fill in segments through successful actions, and failures may cause setbacks.
* **Variable Difficulty** – A Clock might require simple rolls, cumulative successes, or overcoming multiple challenges.
* **Narrative Impact** – Clocks should create tension and influence the game world. A completed Clock might mean an escape is secured, while a failed one could escalate the stakes.
Clocks can also be used to track environmental changes, countdowns to impending doom, or the state of an ongoing battle.
### Example Clock Usage
**Breaking Into the High-Security Vault** (6-segment Clock)
* **Setup:** The party attempts to infiltrate a high-security facility to steal a vital artifact.
* **Clock Segments:**
	1. Bypass external security patrols
	1. Disable or sneak past internal guards
	1. Crack the outer vault security system
	1. Break through the secondary defenses
	1. Deal with unexpected alarms or countermeasures
	1. Retrieve the artifact and escape
* **Possible Consequences:**
	* Completing the clock without failures results in a clean getaway.
	* Partial completion may mean the alarm is raised, but they escape with the item.
	* Failure before completion means they're caught in the act, leading to a desperate escape attempt.

## Resting: Regaining Strength & Strategy
Resting serves as a natural way to refresh resources and prepare for the next phase of the adventure. A **Rest** is a brief period of downtime, at least ten minutes of relative safety, during which characters can:
* Fully recover **HP and Stamina**.
* Restore **one burned Descriptor** (if applicable).
Resting ensures that players have opportunities to recover but should not be overused to remove all tension. The GM and players should determine how accessible resting is based on the game’s pacing and stakes.

## Momentum
To maintain the game’s flow, the concept of **Momentum** can be introduced. Momentum represents the party’s growing advantage or mounting tension based on their actions. Momentum can be gained and consumed when needed.
### Gaining Momentum
Players gain momentum whenever their roll against a TN exceeds it by 10. Another way to gain momentum is by clever roleplaying, which can be granted by GM.
### Using Momentum
When needed players can use a momentum to add a flat bonus to their roll. They can add +1 per momentum used. They can also use 2 momentums to reroll their action and take whichever one they wish. They can choose either one at a time.
