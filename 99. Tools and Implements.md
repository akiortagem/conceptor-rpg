# Tools and Implements

This section describes items, gadgets, tools, weapons, and other objects that might be pivotal to the game and its mechanics.

## Heroes Always Have Their Swords Handy

The chief rule about items, is that the party always brings everything that they need. Since the game focuses on the interesting narrative, the party is not expected to note every little thing that they bring to the adventure. This means that an archer always have their bows and arrows, a gunman always have their glock and ammos, and a samurai, their katana.

You can use this easy rule of thumb to picture this important rule. If a descriptor describes an item that is used, then the character always brings said item. Consider this descriptor

> ***Expert Marksman***
> 
> *After receiving training in Fort Woltham, Jaxon quickly becomes a crack shot. He has an uncanny skill with firearms, able to shoot various kinds of them with high accuracy*
> *Effects: Ranged Attack, Bonus +2*

Then you can count on Jaxon to bring at least a handgun to the adventure. Details on other firearms can be discussed with the GM, but at the very least Jaxon should bring at least one firearm to the adventure. This also includes the ammo.

## Action Heroes Never Run Out of Ammos

You don't need to track each ammo if, say, a descriptor you use describes a ranged weapon that consumes ammunition. The game is designed around the party that is prepared enough to know how much ammunition they need to bring. This also applies to other kinds of items that are ***consumable/expendable*** for the descriptor. Other examples might be a doctor whose descriptor mentions a special formula for limbs regeneration. That drug doesn't need to be tracked, it can be assumed that the doctor brings enough for the adventure.

## But Being Pushed to the Corner Can be Fun!

***However.*** If the story calls for it, ***definitely*** have your heroes lose their favored weapons or run out of ammunitions.

It might be hard to see when this can be applicable, but you can rob your heroes of their implements as a consequence of a failed Clock. If the heroes continuously fails a roll, GMs might be able to leverage this into a success.

Perhaps the party has failed roll after roll on stealthily infiltrating the enemy camp that stands between them and their goal. GMs can rule that the party still passes the camp safely, but had to deplete their ammunition. So they had to burn their descriptors, and recovering them means that they have to find another ammunition source.

## And Powerful Items Can be Pivotal

This does not mean that GMs cannot reward their players with loots, however. Item rewards can be given, but they need to be substantial and pivotal. GMs not need give the party some mere potions or stimpak that only recovers their HP for a bit.

To make it substantial GMs can attach a Descriptor to the item. So, yes Pivotal Items are just extra descriptors that GMs can give to their party.

There are several items-only effects that you can use.

1. ***Limited.*** This effect is followed by a number. That number is how many times the descriptor can be used.
1. ***Autonomous.***
